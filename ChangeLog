	* TODO: Fixed these bug items from the TO-DO list:
	
	* Bring the online help in sync with our commands changes
	
	* Find out why the online help contains the escape sequences like
	~@~T (Eric?)
	
	The first was due to bugs in some macro definitions in sst.c, now
	fixed.  The second was from escape sequences generated into
	sst.doc by xmlto for left-and right-quotes, dashes, and no-break
	spaces; that is fixed by an additional translation step in
	makehelp.py.
	
	xmlto still generates line-drawing characters for the tables in
	the LRSCAN and REPORT help items, but those look OK on an xterm in
	text mode and their help items are suppressed (along with their
	commands) in curses mode.
	
	This is not a completely satisfactory solution, but it will do
	until a design change makes those help items visible again.
