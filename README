			README for Super Star Trek			

Save the Federation from the invading Klingons!  Visit exotic planets and
strip-mine them for dilithium!  Encounter mysterious space thingies!
This is the classic Super Star Trek game from the days of slow teletypes, 
reloaded.

There is one binary, sst.  On-line documentation goes to /usr/share/doc/sst.
