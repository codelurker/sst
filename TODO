		Super Star Trek TO-DO list

* The time machine switch.  Specify a year, get only the features that
  then existed.  (This would be partly so people can try the original
  non-"super" version Matuszek and Reynolds wrote.)

  Dave Matuszek tells me that SRSCAN, MOVE, PHASERS, CALL, STATUS,
  IMPULSE, PHOTONS, ABANDON, LRSCAN, WARP, SHIELDS, DESTRUCT CHART,
  REST, DOCK, QUIT, and DAMAGE were in the original non-"super" version.

* Add a field to the report indicating whether we have dilithium.

* Look:

Track for torpedo number 1-  6 - 5   7 - 6   8 - 7   ***Commander at Sector 8 - 7 damaged-- displaced by blast to Sector 9 - 8

Track for torpedo number 2-  6 - 5   7 - 6   8 - 6
9 - 7
***Commander at Sector 9 - 8 destroyed.
