		Super Star Trek TO-DO list

* The time machine switch.  Specify a year, get only the features that
  then existed.  (This would be partly so people can try the original
  non-"super" version Matuszek and Reynolds wrote.)

* Code to hurl you out of quadrant if a supernova occurs as you warp in 
  seems to hang.
