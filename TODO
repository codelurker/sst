		Super Star Trek TO-DO list

* The time machine switch.  Specify a year, get only the features that
  then existed.  (This would be partly so people can try the original
  non-"super" version Matuszek and Reynolds wrote.)

  Dave Matuszek tells me that SRSCAN, MOVE, PHASERS, CALL, STATUS,
  IMPULSE, PHOTONS, ABANDON, LRSCAN, WARP, SHIELDS, DESTRUCT, CHART,
  REST, DOCK, QUIT, and DAMAGE were in the original non-"super" version.

* Code to hurl you out of quadrant if a supernova occurs as you warp in 
  seems to hang.
