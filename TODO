		Super Star Trek TO-DO list

* Remove the assumption that sst.doc lives in the current directory.

* Do a manual page.

* Improve the internal pager.

* Yes-no confirmations and "press-to-continue" situations should print
  a recognizable standard prompt.

* A real release, with downloadable tarballs and RPMs and so forth.

* The time machine switch.  Specify a year, get only the features that
  then existed.  (This would be partly so people can try the original
  non-"super" version Matuszek and Reynolds wrote.)

  Dave Matuszek tells me that SRSCAN, MOVE, PHASERS, CALL, STATUS,
  IMPULSE, PHOTONS, ABANDON, LRSCAN, WARP, SHIELDS, DESTRUCT CHART,
  REST, DOCK, QUIT, and DAMAGE were in the original non-"super" version.

* Write a curses-based interface.  Shouldn't be hard, all output goes through
  prout/proutn/prouts so we can split the screen into two panes with the upper
  one for the charts.
