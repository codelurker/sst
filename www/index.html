<h1 align='center'><code>Super Star Trek</code> &mdash; a classic computer game</h1>

<p>Save the Federation from the invading Klingons!  Visit exotic
planets and strip-mine them for dilithium!  Encounter mysterious space
thingies!  This is the home page of the classic Super Star Trek game
from the days of slow teletypes, reloaded.</p>

<p>SST2K is a modern Unix port of the University of Texas "Super Star
Trek" game originally written in FORTRAN in the mid-1970s.  It has
options to restrict its feature set to what was in earlier versions.</p>

<p>SST2K is a kind of time machine back to what interactive programs were
like in the days of hardcopy terminals, before graphics and before
even video displays. Despite this archaism and decades after it was 
written, SST2K retains significant play value.  We think it's both fun
and instructive to see how good a game could be written under those
conditions.</p>

<p>Presently the code is available only via <a
href='https://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=2492'>Subversion</a>
at the <a href='https://developer.berlios.de/projects/sst/'>SST
Project Page</a> on berlios.de.  It builds and runs. We expect to do
an actual release Real Soon Now.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can at least browse the <a href='sst-doc.html'>game
documentation</a>.

<p>You can read the project's <a href='TODO'>to-do list</a>.  If
you want to help with these things, here are the project mailing
lists:</p>

<ul>
<li><a
href="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/sst-users">sst-users</a>
is for questions and technical support on <code>sst</code>.</p></li>

<li><a
href="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/sst-devel">sst-dev</a>
is for <code>sst</code> developers.</p></li>

<li><a
href="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/sst-commit-watch">sst-commit-watch</a>
carries notifications of commits to the Subversion archive.  It is
recommended that developers subscribe to this.</p></li> </ul>
</ul>

<p>Tom Almy, one of the SST project founders, has <a
href='http://www.almy.us/sst.html'>an SST page of his own</a>.</p>

<p>There is a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Star_Trek'>Wikipedia 
entry</a>.</p>

<p>SST is fairly closely related to Eric Allman's BSD Trek, which also started
life as a C translation of UT Super Star Trek.  BSD Trek is missing most of
the post-1978 features of SST2K, but does add a cloaking device for the 
Romulans.</p>

<p>The only other really current Star Trek port we know of is 
<a href='http://shankel.best.vwh.net/opentrek.html'>OpenTrek</a>,
which appears to be set in the ST:TNG universe (featuring the Borg
Collective as the villains) and has a fancy graphical interface.</p>

<p>(There are also some multi-player Trek variants out there, notably
XTrek and NetTrek, that have a very different feel from any of the
Trek solitaires.)</p>

<p>For a truly retro-Trek experience, see the <a

Archive</a>.</p>
